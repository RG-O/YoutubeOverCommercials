    <h2>Auto Commercial Detection Mode</h2>
    <p>
        This mode works by the user (you) selecting a specific pixel on a logo/graphic that only displays when your live game/sport/race/event/program/show is on. Then, the extension continuously checks to 
        see if the pixel selected remains the same color when the logo/graphic is displayed. When the color changes, we know this is most likely due to a commercial because the logo/graphic went away and since 
        commercials are boring, the extension starts playing your YouTube video overtop of the commercial. When the logo/graphic color comes back, we know your live program/show/sport/event is most likely back on, 
        so the extension pauses/hides your YouTube video.

    <h3 style="color: red;">Quick Instructions:</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>
            Make sure your live game/program is on (out of commercial).
            <ol type="i">
                <li>
                    If this isn't going to be anytime soon, refresh the page and hit the extension keyboard shortcut when it is back.
                </li>
            </ol>
        </li>
        <li>Click on a pixel outside this box that is within a non-transparent logo or graphic on your game/program (see tips/tricks below for more details).</li>
        <li>
            Let the extension automatically detect the commercials and display your YouTube videos over top of them.
            <ol type="i">
                <li>
                    You can also manually display/hide your YouTube video, temporarily disabling the auto detection, at any point by hitting the extension keyboard shortcut.

    <h3>Tips/Tricks:</h3>

            <b>Selecting a Pixel</b>: Automatically detecting commercials accross all games/sports/leagues/shows/networks accross all streaming platforms isn't an exact science.
            What will make you your experience the best is selecting the best pixel to monitor that you can. You'll want to prioritize selecting a pixel within the channel logo (e.g. the NBC logo).
            Within the channel logo, you'll want to try to select a color that isn't white/black (e.g. the blue inside the NBC logo). You'll want to aim for as center mass of the color as possible.
            If the logo is only black or white, these will do, prioritize white then black, the only issue you may run into with these is if a commercial has a lot of white or black in them it could trigger
            a false flag indicating that the commercials have ended, but this is still better than the lowest priority pixel location option. If the full channel logo has transparency, it will not work. The lowest
            priority pixel location option, but still often works just fine, would be to select any color (prioritize non-black/white colors) that seems to be the most consistant on a graphic on the game, this is most
            often some part of the score graphic. If you chose this to be your pixel location, make sure to set your "Color Mismatch Count Threshold" in the advanced settings of the extension settings to a higher number
            like 45, as many networks hide the score graphic while showing replays and we don't want to accidentally play a YouTube video overtop of a replay. If this instruction box is blocking your desired pixel location,
            go into the advanced settings of the extension settings and modify the overlay video width, height, and/or X/Y display, as this is where the YouTube video is going to display. If you would like to change your 
            pixel selection location at any point, refresh the page and hit the extension keyboard shortcut.
        </li>
        <li>
            <b>Manual Override</b>: As mentioned above, you can manually overide displaying/hiding your YouTube video and temporarily disable the auto commercial detection by hitting the extension keyboard shortcut. You may
            need to do this semi-often if your pixel selection is in a score graphic. This extension also has option for manual mode, where it doesn't try to automatically detect the commercials at all, you will just need to
            hit the extension keyboard shortcut every time a commercial begins or ends. This mode can be set in the extension settings. Regardless of if using automatic or manual mode, if computer is hooked up to play through TV,
            I highly recommend downloading <i>Touch Portal</i> or <i>Deckboard</i> from the app store on your phone and setting up a shortcut for the extension keyboard shortcut so you can control this extension on your computer
            from your phone.

            <b>Changing YouTube Videos</b>: You can set what YouTube video, playlist, or live video you want to play over top of the commercials by grabbing the video ID or playlist ID from YouTube and plugging it into the
            extension settings while also selecting the overlay video type. This extension also allows some non-YouTube videos and live streams to play over top of commercials (e.g. playing YouTubeTV overtop of YouTubeTV commercials). 
            You can try some out by pasting the URL of the desired non-YouTube video into the extension settings.
